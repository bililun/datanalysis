# datanalysis: a visual analysis of the words in songs

This program visualizes the relationship between words in songs in an aesthetically pleasing way. 

## bureaucratic details

The program was written for AT Computer Science 2018-19 taught by Ann Greyson.

## understanding the visualization

Each word is arranged alphabetically in a circle and linked to the words following it in the song. The connecting lines are darker to indicate close-together words and thicker to indicate a higher frequency of that pairing. Photos of a few select visualizations are available [here](/photos).

## processing

[Processing 3](processing.org) was used to visualize this project.

## notes on the songs included

A few songs are included in the /data folder, and some have photos of the visualization in the /photos folder:

Old Town Road by Lil Nas X: my favorite aesthetically. [photo](/photos/oldtownroad.png)

Rap God by Eminem: this song has so many words. in order to fit them all, the canvas must be adjusted to 8000 x 8000, and it almost crashed my computer. warning.

Sugar, Sugar by The Archies: an incredibly repetitive song.

Girls/Girls/Boys by Panic! at the Disco and Roxanne by The Police are also included but I don't have any notes on them.
